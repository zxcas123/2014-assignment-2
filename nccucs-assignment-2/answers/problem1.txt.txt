Operations :
CreateGraph graphName //Create a new graph 
CreateNode nodeName cost //Create a new node named nodeName with non-negative integer cost 
AddNode graphName nodeName //Add a node named nodeName to the graph named graphName
AddEdge graphName parentNode childNode //Create an edge in the graph named graphName from parentNode to childNode.
ListNodes graphName //List nodes in the graph named graphName
ListChildren graphName parentNode //List children and its parent in the graph 
FindPath graphName from1 [from2 [from3 ... ] ] -> to1 [ to2 [ to3 ... ] ] //Find the shortest path among nodes
